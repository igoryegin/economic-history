Mortality in Moscow Region in 1888-1891

This is a small project dedicated to analysis and visualisation of mortality statistics in Moscow Governorate from 1888 to 1891. It is known from sources that an influenza outbreak occured in 1889 in Moscow, but back then, 'influenza' was not included in a list of causes of death. We performed an analysis in order to find out if the mortality increase was singificant, and which death causes were mentioned instead of flu.
